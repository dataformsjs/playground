* If you find a typo or grammar error please fix and submit.
* Additional language template translations are needed. Refer to the main project if you can help with translations.
* Any changes to the core code will likely not be accepted unless you first open an issue. A lot of security is needed in order to make this site work so every line of code must be carefully considered.
* If you think you’ve found an issue with security or have additional security ideas please open an issue. No financial transactions, etc are dependent on this site so opening a public issue is ok.
